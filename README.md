Player 56s
==========

Player 56s is simple in use web audio-player with a playlist and ability
to enable minimalistic view mode.

Player 56s was made for an international art community and a record label
[56stuff.com](http://www.56stuff.com/) and published as open-souce with
the permission of the company.

Player 56s based on [Jouele](https://github.com/ilyabirman/Jouele) web player
by Ilya Birman and Evgeniy Lazarev. I have been inspired by simplicity and style
of their project. Thank you guys.

a default player without playlist.

You can add several tracks to one player. Add to two or more anchors atrribute
'rel' with the same value. It will become one player with ability to switch
tracks.

    <a href="audios/yh_cabin.mp3" class="player56s" rel="group1">Yellowhead - Cabin Pressure</a>

Swich player to the minimalistic view with adding 'minimal' css class to the
anchor and attribute 'data-length' with length of track in format 'M:SS'.
